# Si7006-Breakout-Board
This is a little Breakout board that I made to test the Si7006 instead of using a franksteinlike p2p mount.

R1 and R2 are I2C pull-up resistors in a 0805 package, 10kohm is ok.
C1 is a little 100nF 0805 package capacitor, use whatever that you have on your junkbox.

I want to thanks DIYmodules.org for supplying the Eagle Library.
